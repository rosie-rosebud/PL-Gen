# Welcome to PL-Gen
PL-Gen is a Professional Learning Generator that will take your topics of interest and the amount of time you have available, and give you options for some Professional Learning tasks you can take part in. It is currently a proof of concept tool so isn't fully functional yet!

<b>Developer Notes</b>
<br>
<br>
This tool has been produced as a proof of concept and thus is at its most basic form. Plans for future development include:
<ul>
  <li>Improved use of HTML and CSS for a more user-friendly interface. Eventually I would like there to be more engaging buttons, colour-coded themes (e.g. colour-coded areas of interest or perhaps types of learning).</li>
  <li>Provide multiple options for each time slot, perhaps generated randomly so that someone with five minutes to spare will not always see the same five minute options but instead their option will be randomised every time. This will require a relatively large, and regularly updated, training database so that the tool is always helpful for users.</li>
  <li>Multimedia training resources including videos, podcasts, readings, and links to external training materials such as Microsoft Educator.</li>
  <li>A way for users to log in so that the system can track which trainings they have completed so that it doesn't offer them trainings they have already done.</li>
  <li>Development of both a website and a mobile application.</li>
</ul>
